# Jelastic Pricing Calculator Widget

[Jelastic Pricing Calculator](https://jelastic.com/pay-per-use/#cloud-pricing-calculator) widget is an interactive tool that estimates the environment cost based on the configured topology. It is based on the standard HTML, js, and CSS technologies supported by all modern browsers, which ensures easy installation on any page without any additional requirements. Also, the initialization is performed in the background and does not affect the page loading speed.

Widget addition to your site can be accomplished in a few simple steps:

1. All the required scripts and styles for the pricing calculator widget are stored in the dedicated `j-calculator` directory. You can get this folder from the appropriate [repository](https://github.com/jelastic/jelastic-calculator-widget). For example, with the following command:

    ```html
    git clone https://github.com/jelastic/jelastic-calculator-widget.git
    ```
    
    `Tip: If you want to customize the widget appearance, refer to the linked section and adjust files within the directory up to your needs.`

2. Add the `j-calculator` folder downloaded in the previous step to your site's root folder and insert the following lines between the `<head>` and `</body>` tags of the required page:

    ```html
    <script src="{siteUrl}/j-calculator/3dparty/ejs.js"></script>
    <script src="{siteUrl}/j-calculator/j-calculator.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{siteUrl}/j-calculator/j-calculator.min.css">
    ```
    Don’t forget to correctly substitute your ***{siteUrl}*** placeholder.

3. Now, insert the following block at the position the widget should be displayed at:

    ```html
    <div class="j-calculator" data-key="app.{hoster_domain}"></div>
    ```
    
    `
    IMPORTANT: The data-key parameter allows displaying pricing for your specific platform only. If skipped, a platform selector list will be displayed.
    `
    
The default ready-to-work pricing calculator widget looks as follows:

If needed, you can adjust the widget by tuning predefined ranges and values or customize the whole widget by adjusting its source code.

### Customize Widget Parameters

### Customize Widget Layout

If needed, the widget can be fully customized to match your particular needs and brand look. The project is built based on the **Gulp** with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor, which provides access to the following features:

- CSS auto-prefixing
- built-in preview server with BrowserSync
- compile sass with libsass
- lint and minify scripts
- image optimization

In order to perform customization to the project, you’ll need a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server of 6 or higher version.

1. Install the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) utility with the following command:

    ```
    npm install gulp --global
    ```

2. Next, clone the widget repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jelastic/jelastic-calculator-widget.git
    ```
    
3. Move inside the project folder and install dependencies.

    ```
    cd j-calculator
    npm install -d   
    ```
    
4. Start a server with gulp to preview changes.

    ```
    gulp serve
    ```
    
5. You can change CSS in the __assets/scss/*.scss__ file. For example, the default variables:

    ```
    $laptop: 1366px; // default media query sizes
    $tablet: 1024px;
    $mobile: 768px;
    $extraSmall: 475px;
    $mainColor: #0087ff; // default color (Application Server)
    $dbColor: #ffb000; // default orange color (Database)
    $balancerColor: #09b475; // default blue color (Load Balancer)
    ```
    
6. Once you are satisfied with the results, build the production environments.

    ```
    gulp default
    ```
    
    In a moment, you will have the following files in the j-calculator folder:
    
    - __index.html__ - example with widget initialization selector
    - __j-calculator.min.js__ - minified JavaScript
    - __j-calculator.min.css__ - minified CSS
    
    Use these files instead of the default ones during the widget addition to your website page.
    
7. Additionally, for the best performance, some images are saved in the SVG format, optimized with the [svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) service and included in CSS/SCSS with the BASE64 technology via [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org/). Non-converted images can be located in the __assets/img/__ folder.

Now, you have all the required information to customize (if needed) and integrate the Jelastic Pricing Calculator widget to your website.
